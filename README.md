Contents:

Python code regarding nmr hamiltonians of coupled spins used to produce figures for eigenvalues against a varying coupling constant.

Figures produced for a varying coupling constant:-
  1. Mixed state energys detailed.
  2. All energys detailed.

The derivation of the Hamiltonian matrix using the kronecker product solution.

Figure of an nmr spectrum.
